# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the 2024 version Advent of Code.

This is the first time I am using Kotlin as I am very much a Java developer by career. There will be a lot of learnings and refactoring as I go along.

My approach to these solutions will be about:

* **Kotlin first**: This exercise is about learning the features of Kotlin, so I want to take advantage of that rather than relying on what I already know in plain old Java.
* **Verbosity**: I never write obfuscated looking code. I like to think the code I write is easy to understand. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of comments unless a line looks complicated or a code block appears in a specific space.
* **Minimal library**: In my day job, I tend to rely on libraries all the time. However, my intention with these solutions is to not rely on any 3rd party library that is not already part of the Kotlin/Java core.
* **Efficiency**: There is a trade-off here against verbosity as efficient/clever pieces of logic do not necessarily lend themselves well to reading and understanding it with ease. However, I will look for optimal solutions where I can.

I hope you enjoy reading. I am always open to constructive feedback.

## Running the solutions
At the project root, simply execute on the terminal:

`./gradlew run`

At some point, I plan on moving the each of solutions to execute as individual unit tests.
